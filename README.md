I'm planning to find some more Katas concerning UI development. Right now there is just one exercise here:

- [Additional_Validation](https://github.com/emilybache/UI-Katas/tree/master/Additional_Validation)

If you have ideas for good katas, please let me know. I'm on twitter as @emilybache, or you can contact me via my company website [contact form](http://bacheconsulting.com/contact-us).
